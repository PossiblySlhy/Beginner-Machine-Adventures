# Beginner-Machine-Adventures

## Purpose
I'm a beginner in the realm of cybersecurity and PenTesting. These files are notes that document my process in cracking beginner machines, both failures and successes.

## Resources
Currently, I'm making my way through TCM Security's PNPT course. I will update this with more as I continue learning.

## Tools Used
I'm using mainly VS Code for markdown editing, however I'm continuing to experiment with other note taking tools. All of my notes are currently in markdown.

All work is done from an EndeavourOS machine that I've installed PenTesting tools as needed on. Beginner machines are being hosted via VirtualBox VMs. Any specific tools will be mentioned in the box notes.
