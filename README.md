# Beginner-Machine-Adventures

## Purpose
I'm a beginner in the realm of cybersecurity and PenTesting. These files are notes that document my process in cracking beginner machines, both failures and successes.

## Resources
Currently, I'm making my way through TCM Security's PNPT course. I will update this with more as I continue learning.
